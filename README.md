# DeauthKeychain â€“ ESP32-C3 Wi-Fi Deauthentication Tool  

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zRCrackiiN/DeauthKeychain?style=social)](https://github.com/zRCrackiiN/DeauthKeychain)  

This project is a **Wi-Fi deauthentication tool** for the **ESP32-C3**, capable of scanning nearby networks and sending **deauth packets** to disconnect clients from their access points.  

## Features  
âœ… **Automatic Wi-Fi Scanning** â€“ Detects and stores access points (APs) within range.  
âœ… **Mass Deauthentication** â€“ Sends multiple deauth packets per AP to disrupt client connections.  
âœ… **ESP32-C3 Optimized** â€“ Uses `esp_wifi_80211_tx()` for raw frame injection.  
âœ… **Efficient Packet Transmission** â€“ Sends **100 deauth frames per AP** for increased effectiveness.  
âœ… **Minimal Delay** â€“ Rapid execution with only **10ms delay** between deauth cycles.  
âœ… **Multi-Environment Support** â€“ Easily switch between different attack modes using **PlatformIO environments**.  

## Hardware Requirements  
- **ESP32-C3** development board  
- USB-C cable for flashing firmware  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zRCrackiiN/DeauthKeychain.git
   ```  
2. Install **PlatformIO** or **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 board support.
3. Select your enviroment.
4. Flash the firmware to your ESP32-C3 board.  

## Multi-Environment Support (PlatformIO)  
This project is designed to support **multiple attack modes** using PlatformIOâ€™s environment configuration. Each mode has its own `main.cpp`, automatically selected during compilation.  

### Available Environments:  
| Environment | Function |
|------------|----------|
| `deauth`   | Scans for nearby networks and sends **deauth packets** to disconnect clients. |
| `beacon_spam` | Floods the airwaves with **fake beacon frames**, creating multiple rogue access points. |

### Compiling & Uploading:  
To build and upload a specific environment, use:  
```sh
pio run -e [environment_name] -t upload
```  
Replace `[environment_name]` with one of the available environments, e.g., `deauth` or `beacon_spam`.  

## Usage  

### **Deauthentication Attack**  
- Flash the `deauth` environment to your ESP32-C3.  
- Upon startup, the device will scan for nearby networks and send deauth packets to disconnect clients.  

### **Beacon Spam Attack**  
- Flash the `beacon_spam` environment to your ESP32-C3.  
- The device will broadcast numerous fake beacon frames to simulate multiple rogue access points.

Unauthorized use of deauthentication or beacon spam attacks is illegal in many jurisdictions. **Only use on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.**
