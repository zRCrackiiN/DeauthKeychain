# DeauthKeychain â€“ ESP32-C3 Wi-Fi Deauthentication Tool  

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zRCrackiiN/DeauthKeychain?style=social)](https://github.com/zRCrackiiN/DeauthKeychain)  
This project is a **Wi-Fi deauthentication tool** for the **ESP32-C3**, capable of scanning nearby networks and sending **deauth packets** to disconnect clients from their access points.  

## Features  
âœ… **Automatic Wi-Fi Scanning** â€“ Detects and stores access points (APs) within range.  
âœ… **Mass Deauthentication** â€“ Sends multiple deauth packets per AP to disrupt client connections.  
âœ… **ESP32-C3 Optimized** â€“ Uses `esp_wifi_80211_tx()` for raw frame injection.  
âœ… **Efficient Packet Transmission** â€“ Sends **100 deauth frames per AP** for increased effectiveness.  
âœ… **Minimal Delay** â€“ Rapid execution with only **10ms delay** between deauth cycles.  

## Hardware Requirements  
- **ESP32-C3** development board  
- USB-C cable for flashing firmware  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zRCrackiiN/DeauthKeychain.git
   ```  
2. Install **PlatformIO** or **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 board support.  
3. Flash the firmware to your ESP32-C3 board.  

## Usage  
- **Power on the ESP32-C3**, and it will automatically:  
  - Scan for Wi-Fi networks.  
  - Send **deauth packets** to every detected AP.  
  - Continuously loop with minimal delay for maximum disruption.
